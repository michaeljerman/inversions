# Temperature inversions

GeoTIFFs created from AIRS data. The method used is similar to that described by Jans, Johansson, and Nilsson (2018).

"Ascending" refers to daytime observations, "descending" are nighttime inversions. A raster value of 1 corresponds to an observed inversion, 0 otherwise. Pixels with missing data are coded NA.
